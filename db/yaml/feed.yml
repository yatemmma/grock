    width=\"635\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Alex is our guest on this week&#39;s <strong><a
    href=\"http://smarturl.it/rocksoundpod\">Rock Sound Podcast</a> </strong>where
    he discussed the thinking behind the bands recent surprise release of singles
    &#39;Everything Is Fine&#39; and &#39;Birthday&#39;:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"We thought
    about doing a deluxe album or something like that, being that we were a year removed
    from &lsquo;Last Young Renegade&rsquo;. But it just didn&rsquo;t feel like it
    fit the vibe of the record. The new stuff we were writing and creating, it just
    didn&rsquo;t gel. I think &lsquo;Last Young Renegade&rsquo; really set itself
    apart as a very self-contained thing. It was very much it&rsquo;s own thing. It
    was sort of the first concept-y kind of record that All Time Low had ever done.
    So we didn&rsquo;t wanna tarnish it by trying to tack on other songs connected
    to it. But, like I said, we had written and recorded these fun, summery-vibe songs
    and it felt like the right time to put those out. So we dropped them and it seems
    to be the best way we could have done it.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Plus, Alex revealed
    that the band could potentially be continuing this release strategy in the future,
    rather than dropping a full album:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"There&rsquo;s a lot of music
    kicking around, I will say that. I&rsquo;m not sure what form it&rsquo;s gonna
    take yet. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gonna be an album or if we&rsquo;re
    just gonna keep kicking around these soft releases, so to speak. The way I looked
    at this one was kind of like the old 7 inch vinyls where you get an a-side and
    a b-side from back in the day...So that seems really fun and maybe we&rsquo;ll
    keep doing that for now or maybe this is the link towards an album. But what I
    love is that there&rsquo;s no pressure. It&rsquo;s really fun as a band in this
    day and age to be able to think about it in the moment. We&rsquo;re not necessarily
    committed to putting out 15 songs now. It&rsquo;s just like &lsquo;hey, let&rsquo;s
    see how this goes&rsquo;. We can kind of pivot and have fun with it based on what
    we&rsquo;re feeling. It&rsquo;s fun to have that flexibility.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Check

    on this album for so long- it&rsquo;s been two years since we released any music
    but we really feel this time has refined our sound into something we think is
    worthy of its place in the world. The mix of styles is more cohesive,&nbsp; and
    all in all it just flows better. I feel like my vocals have stepped up massively
    and there&rsquo;s still so much more I can do. I can&rsquo;t wait to play all
    these songs live and hopefully improve even further.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Listen

    a day that has gone by that I haven&rsquo;t thought of you. I miss you, and it
    still hurts to not have you here. I chose not to speak at your memorial because
    I couldn&rsquo;t formulate the words to adequately express how I felt... I chose
    not to speak at the Celebration of Life Concert honoring you because I knew I&rsquo;d
    struggle to even be able to speak at all. And today, a year after your passing,
    I still struggle to try and eloquently express what you mean to your family, your
    friends, your fans... and to me. There is so much that I feel, and that I could
    say, and that I would want to say, and that I don&rsquo;t know how to say... but
    one thing I know for certain, is that you are loved, and you are missed.&nbsp;<br

    Havana frontman James Veck Gilodi says <em>&ldquo;It was just a weird, fast melody

    Royale&nbsp;</strong>have released &#39;You&#39;ll Be Fine&#39;- the first single
    from their highly anticipated upcoming album &#39;Boom Boom Room Side B&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking
    about the themes of &#39;You&#39;ll Be Fine&#39;, frontman Remington Leith says<em>
    &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll Be Fine&rsquo; is a step into the new world of Palaye
    Royale. Steaming from the live show atmosphere, we took the moments of aggression,
    violence and excitement by putting in all in one song. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll Be
    Fine&rsquo; was written in the perspective of a schizophrenic patient (same patient
    as Mr. Dr Man talked about). In today&rsquo;s society everyone around you will
    always say &lsquo;it will be fine&rsquo;. In this video we address the topics
    that people tend to not frequently talk about. Mental health and freedom within
    existence.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p>Palaye Royale have also released the offcial
    music video for &#39;You&#39;ll Be Fine&#39;, which theoretically continues the
    narrative from &#39;Ragdoll&#39; off &#39;Boom Boom Room Side A&#39;. This is
    based around the lyric \"<em>Lost in the mental estate; they say I&#39;m okay,
    oh, as they&#39;re dragging me away</em>\" from &#39;Ragdoll&#39;, and the video
    for &#39;You&#39;ll Be Fine&#39; which sees Emerson and Sebastian speeding down
    a highway, with Remington confined to a strait jacket in the back of the car.</p>\n\n<blockquote

    as representing the sound of a generation left to rot in the margins, the quintent
    hail from the streets of Glasgow &ndash; a city where nearly half of young people

    Film
  body: "\n\t\t\t\n          <p>Sugar, we&#39;re goin&#39; down the rabbit hole.</p>\n\n\n<p><img
    alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.rocksound.tv/assets/uploads/FallOutBoy14_o2march2018.jpg\"
    style=\"width: 635px; height: 423px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Patrick Stump is truly a multi-talented
    man. Not only is he the dulcet-toned voice behind Fall Out Boy, a multi-instrumentalist,
    and producer (not forgetting he played all the instruments on AND produced his
    solo album &#39;Soul Punk&#39;)- he&#39;s also a composer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It
    has been announced that Patrick is scoring a modern film adaptation of Alice In
    Wonderland, with the film going in to production next month.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Following
    his composer credits in Gnome Alone and the forthcoming Changeland, this will
    be his third film score.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Speaking to Entertainment Weeky, Patrick
    has reflected on the difference between scoring a film and writing Fall Out Boy
    songs, saying&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re doing a score, it&rsquo;s kind
    of like acting, really, because you have to get in the head of a character, whereas
    with Fall Out Boy, if I&rsquo;m writing a song, I&rsquo;m going to have to get
    on stage every night and sing that. It&rsquo;s really for me. Writing a song is
    more &mdash; not selfish, but you&rsquo;re focused on what you would want, whereas
    in a film you&rsquo;re just focused on telling the story.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p>The
    modern adaptation of Lewis Carrol&#39;s Alice In Wonderland being directed by
    Jessica Sherif, and is set in Hollywood dealing with themes of the struggle of
    women in the entertainment industry.&nbsp;</p>\n        "

    accompanies Lights&#39; 2017 album &#39;Skin &amp; Earth&#39; is getting a television
    adaptation.</p>\n\n<p>But that&#39;s not all- in the announcement from Entertainment
    One who have picked up the project, &#39;Skin &amp; Earth&#39; will also be adapted
    for gaming content.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking about the news, Lights has said<em> \"Music
    has always been a visual thing to me, so writing and drawing the &#39;Skin &amp;
    Earth&#39; comics, which tie cohesively with the music, was an obvious move for
    me as an artist. That then led to bringing the characters and story to life in
    other ways like in my music videos, interactive Instagram accounts and graphic
    novel and on stage in my live show. Now that those floodgates are open, I am beyond
    excited to explore my relationship with eOne and introducing the characters and
    ethos of&nbsp;Skin&amp;Earth&nbsp;to new audiences.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p>She
    also took to twitter to share the news, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lights/status/1019318798959038464\">tweeting</a>
    <em>\"Been trying to hold this in for a while. Here comes the next phase of Skin&amp;Earth\".</em></p>\n\n<p>As
    yet, no official release date has been announced, but Lights is making an appearance
    at San Diego Comic Con this weekend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lights is one of the most
    fearless figures in our world! She&#39;s on the cover of the Rock Sound 50, which

    Pete Wentz&#39; right-hand man at DCD2 Records, who represents nothing,nowhere.
    told us \"<em>This is that &#39;driving on the highway at night&#39; or &#39;laying
    in your room alone&#39; type of song. It just takes me back, and it&#39;s something
    you can listen to and interpret in your own way, and apply it to anything you
    have gone through personally. Parts of it actually reminded me of how dark and
    personal&nbsp;The Weeknd&rsquo;s first EPs were. That wasn&rsquo;t a direct influence,
    but it adds another layer, and acts almost as an interlude for the whole album.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>You

    to have their highest ever chart debut.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Taking to twitter to share
    the exciting news, Bury Tomorrow posted \"<em>Black Flame has arrived at #11 ont

    to an unsuspecting person&#39;s back yard, and jumping in their pool.</p>\n\n<p>Also,

    Absolute gold.</p>\n\n<p>Commenting on the video shoot, Jordan says <em>&ldquo;filming
    for this video was actually wild. We changed our minds last minute and decided
    to try and make it goofy. We&rsquo;ve always been so serious so we decided why
    not. Even though the song isn&rsquo;t on the goofy side, it&rsquo;s a pop banger.
    So I figured why not have some damn fun.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p>And it really is

    lives,now we won&rsquo;t be holding onto the worry of people finding out and now
    our families can share their excitement too. I couldn&rsquo;t be a luckier person
    to have such a wonderful life with these two. I never knew I was capable of loving
    so much until I met Geoff and then that love became something I can&rsquo;t even

  title: Watch As It Is’ Patty Walters Deliver A Powerful Speech About Mental Health
    At Warped Tour
  body: "\n\t\t\t\n          <p><strong>As It Is&nbsp;</strong>frontman Patty Walters
    got incredibly real on a recent Warped Tour date.</p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.rocksound.tv/assets/uploads/as_it_is___Slamdunk_South_@BENGIBSONPHOTO-0190.jpg\"
    style=\"width: 635px; height: 424px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>As It Is have been particularly
    upfront about the important and oftentimes difficult topics that their new album
    &#39;The Great Depression&#39; deals with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Patty Walters has spoken
    to us at length about the important messages around mental health in the album
    both on the <a href=\"http://smarturl.it/rocksoundpod\">Rock Sound Podcast</a>,
    and in the huge <a href=\"http://shop.rocksound.tv\">As It Is cover feature inside
    our current issue</a>. But over the weekend Patty delivered an emotional and important
    speech around his own personal mental health on stage at Warped Tour.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Before
    launching in to &#39;The Wounded World&#39;, Patty revealed \"<em>I want to tell
    you guys transparently- I&#39;ve been crying all fuckin&#39; day. I don&#39;t
    know how to put up with myself some days. But I at least know that telling you
    guys- making this shit part of the conversation- it helps.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>He
    goes on to talk about&nbsp;<strong>Linkin Park</strong>&nbsp;frontman Chester
    Bennington, and how the lack of conversation around mental health failed him <em>\"because
    nobody was fucking listening anymore. Giving that guy the resources he fucking
    needed. So it&#39;s about time we make this world a better goddamn place.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Read
    Patty Walters&#39; full speech below:<br />\n\"</strong><em>Before we play this
    song- today I want to go a little off-piece for you if you don&#39;t mind. This
    record is about the societal romanticisation of depression, anxiety, and mental
    health, mental illness. When we were out here on Warped 2015, I didn&#39;t know
    how to fucking cope with myself. I hated myself every single fucking day of that
    tour. And out here- I want to tell you guys transparently- I&#39;ve been crying
    all fuckin&#39; day. I don&#39;t know how to put up with myself some days. </em></p>\n\n<p><em>But
    I at least know that telling you guys- making this shit part of the conversation-
    it helps. It helps me. It helps you. It helps us all here. So lets keep that conversation
    going, but more importantly but PLEASE- let&#39;s fucking listen to each other.
    Because to day is the one year anniversary of Chester Bennington- one of my fucking
    heroes- took his life. Because nobody was fucking listening anymore. Giving that
    guy the resources he fucking needed. So it&#39;s about time we make this world
    a better goddamn place.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Check out the full video below:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote

    style=\"width: 635px; height: 357px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>After teasing and keeping
    everyone in suspense since Friday night,&nbsp;<strong>You Me At Six</strong>&nbsp;have
    announced their plans for celebrating the 10th anniversary of the release of their
    debut album &#39;Take Off Your Colours&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>You Me At Six have announced
    three additional shows as a part of their <a href=\"https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/you-me-at-six-have-announced-a-huge-uk-headline-tour\">November
    tour</a> where they will be playing their debut album &#39;Take Off Your Colours&#39;
    in full. Yep, that means they&#39;re going to have to play &#39;Gossip&#39; live.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Take
    Off Your Colours&#39; was truly the breakthrough moment for You Me At Six, and
    fans have been pretty persistent in requesting an anniversary tour for the album.
    Reflecting on the importance of the album to You Me At Six fans, the band have
    said&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We can&#39;t wait to get out on the road in November and
    play new music from our new album &#39;VI&#39; live. On top of this, we know that
    &#39;Take Off Your Colours&#39; has played a huge part in a lot of our fans&#39;
    lives, and we&#39;re looking forward to playing that through in full on the added
    dates!&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Check out the dates for the &#39;Take Off
    Your Colours&#39; anniversary shows below:</strong><br />\n<strong>NOVEMBER</strong></p>\n\n<p>24

    - LONDON Brixton Academy</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youmeatsix.lnk.to/tourPR\">Pre-sale
    tickets are on sale this Wednesday from here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t the
    first time that You Me At Six have paid tribute to &#39;Take Off Your Colours&#39;,
    but it&#39;s definitely the first time they&#39;ll be playing the entire album
    in its entirety. Back in 2015, the guys performed a tribute set full of &#39;Take
    Off Your Colours&#39; bangers at Slam Dunk. Check out a teaser of that below,

  title: Good Charlotte’s Benji & Joel Madden Reveal Inspiration Behind Single ‘Shadowboxer’
  body: "\n\t\t\t\n          <p><em>\"I have to be kind to myself. I think that&#39;s
    the big question with &#39;Shadowboxer&#39;, those struggles that we all have.\"</em></p>\n\n\n<p><img

    635px; height: 332px;\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Good Charlotte</strong>&#39;s Joel
    and Benji Madden have opened up about the personal topics that have inspired the
    band&#39;s latest material.</p>\n\n<p>The band address mental health struggles
    and self-esteem on their forthcoming album &#39;Generation Rx&#39; with new single
    &#39;Shadowboxer&#39; being a big encapsulation of those themes, as Joel explained:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"That
    song was one of the first songs we wrote for the record...&#39;Generation Rx&#39;
    has been a really kind of raw album facing our own kind of emotional experience
    in the world and I think &#39;Shadowboxer&#39; was really questioning self-esteem
    and looking in the mirror and really asking yourself, what do you say to yourself
    when you look in the mirror? Are you saying positive things, are you loving yourself
    or do you hate yourself? Are you putting yourself down? Are you criticising yourself?
    </em></p>\n\n<p><em>And I think it starts there with me, with my experience, what
    I found is my own mental headspace affects how I look at the world and how I treat
    other people. So it kind of starts with when I look in the mirror - what&#39;s
    the message to myself before I can go out in my day, before I can go out into
    the world and be kind to people and become friends with people? I have to be kind
    to myself. I think that&#39;s the big question with &#39;Shadowboxer&#39;, those
    struggles that we all have.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>The brothers also talked about how
    the song&#39;s music video helps further that conversation, with the mirror analogy
    coming into particular focus.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Watch our chat with Benji and

    alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.rocksound.tv/assets/uploads/unnamed_(48).jpg\" style=\"width:
    635px; height: 423px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you aren&#39;t already a fan of Southampton-based
    metalcore band&nbsp;<strong>Our Hollow, Our Home</strong>, where have you been?</p>\n\n<p>Today
    they&#39;ve announced the details of their upcoming new album. Here&#39;s everything
    you need to know:</p>\n\n<p><strong>01. It&#39;s called &#39;In Moment // In Memory&#39;</strong><br
    />\nAnd it&#39;s an intensely personal journet of both love and loss, centered
    around Our Hollow, Our Home vocalist / guitarist Tobias Young losing his father
    in 2017.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Speaking on the personal aspects of &#39;In Moment //
    In Memory&#39;, Tobias explains <em>&ldquo;In January 2017 I started the initial
    writing process for the second album. &nbsp;This came to a sudden halt when I
    found out that my father was terminally ill with lung cancer. My focus moved to
    spending time with him and my family and away from writing until sadly, just 4
    short months later, my father passed away.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I was left feeling
    very lost and very vulnerable and I didn&rsquo;t know how to deal with these feelings.
    My father was always a strong driving force for me to keep writing and producing
    music. With that said, writing this album became my coping mechanism. As I journeyed
    through the varying stages of grief, with the help of my bandmates, I benchmarked
    my progress with songs about how I had felt, how I had learnt to deal with the
    situation and how I had to learn to keep on moving forward in a life without my
    father.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>We really wanted this album to be something our listeners
    could turn to in a time of need. Just as writing these songs have helped me get
    through one of the most difficult periods of my life, it was equally as important
    to that it would be an honest and relatable listen, and we hope that this record
    will be a companion to anyone taking their own journey.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>02.
    It&#39;s set for release October 19, through their own label&nbsp;//Hollow Music</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>03.
    The album artwork looks a bit like this:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.rocksound.tv/assets/uploads/unnamed_(49).jpg\"

    for &#39;In Moment // In Memory&#39; looks a lot like this:</strong></p>\n\n<p>01.
    //Denial<br />\n02. In Moment<br />\n03. Disconnect<br />\n04. //Anger<br />\n05.

    width=\"635\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Alex is our guest on this week&#39;s <strong><a
    href=\"http://smarturl.it/rocksoundpod\">Rock Sound Podcast</a> </strong>where
    he discussed the thinking behind the bands recent surprise release of singles
    &#39;Everything Is Fine&#39; and &#39;Birthday&#39;:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"We thought
    about doing a deluxe album or something like that, being that we were a year removed
    from &lsquo;Last Young Renegade&rsquo;. But it just didn&rsquo;t feel like it
    fit the vibe of the record. The new stuff we were writing and creating, it just
    didn&rsquo;t gel. I think &lsquo;Last Young Renegade&rsquo; really set itself
    apart as a very self-contained thing. It was very much it&rsquo;s own thing. It
    was sort of the first concept-y kind of record that All Time Low had ever done.
    So we didn&rsquo;t wanna tarnish it by trying to tack on other songs connected
    to it. But, like I said, we had written and recorded these fun, summery-vibe songs
    and it felt like the right time to put those out. So we dropped them and it seems
    to be the best way we could have done it.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Plus, Alex revealed
    that the band could potentially be continuing this release strategy in the future,
    rather than dropping a full album:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"There&rsquo;s a lot of music
    kicking around, I will say that. I&rsquo;m not sure what form it&rsquo;s gonna
    take yet. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gonna be an album or if we&rsquo;re
    just gonna keep kicking around these soft releases, so to speak. The way I looked
    at this one was kind of like the old 7 inch vinyls where you get an a-side and
    a b-side from back in the day...So that seems really fun and maybe we&rsquo;ll
    keep doing that for now or maybe this is the link towards an album. But what I
    love is that there&rsquo;s no pressure. It&rsquo;s really fun as a band in this
    day and age to be able to think about it in the moment. We&rsquo;re not necessarily
    committed to putting out 15 songs now. It&rsquo;s just like &lsquo;hey, let&rsquo;s
    see how this goes&rsquo;. We can kind of pivot and have fun with it based on what
    we&rsquo;re feeling. It&rsquo;s fun to have that flexibility.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Check

    &#39;Crown Shyness&#39; in to the world, saying <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been sitting
    on this album for so long- it&rsquo;s been two years since we released any music
    but we really feel this time has refined our sound into something we think is
    worthy of its place in the world. The mix of styles is more cohesive,&nbsp; and
    all in all it just flows better. I feel like my vocals have stepped up massively
    and there&rsquo;s still so much more I can do. I can&rsquo;t wait to play all
    these songs live and hopefully improve even further.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Listen

    has been a year since your passing - a surreal rotation of grief, heartbreak,
    refusal, and recognition. And yet it still feels like you are close by, surrounding
    us with your memory and your light. Your one-of-a-kind spirit has authored an
    indelible imprint on our hearts- our jokes, out joy and our tenderness.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Eternally
    grateful for the love, life, and creative passion you shared with us and the world.
    We miss you more than words can express.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Love,</em></p>\n\n<p><em>M,

    a day that has gone by that I haven&rsquo;t thought of you. I miss you, and it
    still hurts to not have you here. I chose not to speak at your memorial because
    I couldn&rsquo;t formulate the words to adequately express how I felt... I chose
    not to speak at the Celebration of Life Concert honoring you because I knew I&rsquo;d
    struggle to even be able to speak at all. And today, a year after your passing,

    Royale&nbsp;</strong>have released &#39;You&#39;ll Be Fine&#39;- the first single
    from their highly anticipated upcoming album &#39;Boom Boom Room Side B&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking
    about the themes of &#39;You&#39;ll Be Fine&#39;, frontman Remington Leith says<em>
    &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll Be Fine&rsquo; is a step into the new world of Palaye
    Royale. Steaming from the live show atmosphere, we took the moments of aggression,
    violence and excitement by putting in all in one song. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll Be
    Fine&rsquo; was written in the perspective of a schizophrenic patient (same patient
    as Mr. Dr Man talked about). In today&rsquo;s society everyone around you will
    always say &lsquo;it will be fine&rsquo;. In this video we address the topics
    that people tend to not frequently talk about. Mental health and freedom within
    existence.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p>Palaye Royale have also released the offcial
    music video for &#39;You&#39;ll Be Fine&#39;, which theoretically continues the
    narrative from &#39;Ragdoll&#39; off &#39;Boom Boom Room Side A&#39;. This is
    based around the lyric \"<em>Lost in the mental estate; they say I&#39;m okay,
    oh, as they&#39;re dragging me away</em>\" from &#39;Ragdoll&#39;, and the video
    for &#39;You&#39;ll Be Fine&#39; which sees Emerson and Sebastian speeding down
    a highway, with Remington confined to a strait jacket in the back of the car.</p>\n\n<blockquote
